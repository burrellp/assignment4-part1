Tasks: Worked on the final part of the assignment (login.php, content1.php, and content2.php). Much of this time was spent on Piazza/StackOverflow/php.net/google.com trying to work through problems I ran into. These included having trouble getting session variables to persist through to different websites, logging out properly (clearing session data on logout), and testing for valid login when visiting the content pages. I believe I have most if not all of the requirements accomplished, but I donâ€™t feel all that great about the process. This was definitely the portion of the assignment that I struggled with the most (other than getting my machine to run php files locally).
